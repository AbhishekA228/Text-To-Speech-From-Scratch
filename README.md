TTS Model Enhancement (Jupyter Cloud):
 I enhanced a Text-To-Speech model by fine-tuning it with
 additional datasets, optimizing for accuracy and efficiency. The
 training took place in Jupyter Cloud, leveraging rented GPUs (2
 NVIDIA A100), ensuring robust performance improvements through
 scalable computing resources.
